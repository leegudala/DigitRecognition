# DigitRecognition
Just A python Notebook

Reference for beginers.

This notebook is for beginners approach to proceed with MNIST Digit Recognizer dataset. 
I have tried to cover topics like how to proceed with a **Binary Classification** problem as well as **Multi Class Classification**.
Multi-Class classification strategies like **OnevsOne** and **OnevsAll** classifier has also been discussed.

Any suggestions for improvement or comments are highly appreciated!
